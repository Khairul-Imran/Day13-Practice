This practice is about reading data from a file.

1. Create all the 4 folders -controller, repo, model, service
2. Start by creating the object model (Employee), with all its properties and validations
3. Created an EmployeeRepo
4. Created an EmployeeController
5. Created the form in the template -> follow the same sequence he did.

Command when writing the data:
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--dataDir=/Users/khairulimran/data"

Hyperlink references are always GET requests -> going to the endpoint to fetch something.

Model -> lasts as long as the method itself (till the method completes)
Session -> is preserved until the session ends. (can invalidate or timeout)
